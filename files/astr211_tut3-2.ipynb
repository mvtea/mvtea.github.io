    "Astronomical data often comes with zillions of datapoints, and we have to store them somewhere. Once we've stored them somewhere, we have to be able to read them to do science with them. That's what this tutorial is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very brief introduction to reading from and writing data to files, specifically CSVs (and TSVs). **CSV** files, which have the naming format `file.csv`, are documents containing **c**omma **s**eparated **v**alues; TSVs (tab-separated values) are less common but still relevant. You can think of a CSV as a spreadsheet, where each row is a new line and each entry in a row is separated by a comma. For example, a file `personal-info.csv` may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "firstname,lastname,age,birthmonth,birthyear\n",
    "joe,smith,20,june,1998\n",
    "kate,yang,23,march,2001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row of a CSV typically contains labels for the columns, while the rest of the rows populate those columns. You might wonder why astronomers prefer CSVs to using Excel spreadsheets like normal people, and that's because it's much easier to have a machine parse (read) and append (write to) a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover reading and writing CSV files to the extent that I use it every day as someone who does research and homework that requires it, i.e. the basics. We'll talk about manipulating other types of files (i.e. FITS, the true astronomical filetype of choice) when we talk about telescope data processing in a few weeks."
