    "Now, there are a few things to notice here. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The fact that only one statement is printed.** When Python comes across a line that reads `if <condition>:`, it checks the condition first and then decides what to do next. If the condition is met, of course, it keeps going. If not, it skips the entirety of the code in the conditional statement and moves on to what comes after. So when the above code is run, the number can't be simultaneously greater-than and less-than zero, and just one print statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The boolean in the conditional _is a boolean_.** If you were to try to write `if 12: <do something>`, you'd get an error. You could write `if (12 == 12): <do something>`, and that would be perfectly valid, but `12` alone doesn't have an inherent truth or falsity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indentation/whitespace.** When using a structure like an if-else statement, _whitespace_ (empty space in the code) is important. It tells the program where to look for it's next task. If there was no indentation, Python would assume that the next line of code was separate from the conditional statement, and run the code no matter whether the condition was met or not. Everything indented under the `if` statement is what we call _nested_ under it, and thus will only run if the boolean condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main thing to notice is that, if you run that code and enter a number, it works! Nice. You may be wondering where the \"else\" in \"if-else statement\" comes from, however. That's because the conventional way to write the code above is as follows:"
