    "In my research on X-ray binaries, I utilize the Novikov-Thorne thin accretion disk approximation for black holes, which relates the temperature of the accertion disk to the mass of the accretor. Typical disk temperatures range between 0.5 and 1.0 keV. Using this relationship, calculate the mass of black holes (a) within this range, (b) in the \"interesting\" regime of 1.0 to 3.0 keV, and (c) in the \"crazy\" range of >5.0 keV. Plot your results, making sure the three regimes are clearly labeled in your plot.\n",
