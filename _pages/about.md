**Hi!** I’m Mason, and I’m currently a systems engineer at the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://www.stsci.edu/), supporting integration and testing for the [Webb (JWST)](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) and [Roman](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/) space telescope ground systems. 

I finished my undergrad in astronomy and physics at Wesleyan University in 2021 with high honors in astronomy. My honors thesis focused on identifying and characterizing new black hole X-ray binaries (XRBs) in nearby galaxies with the [_Chandra_](https://chandra.harvard.edu/) archive. Earlier in my undergraduate career, I worked on simulating and de-convolving data from the Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL).

The broad theme of my research interests is “gravity”: in theory and observation, both quantum and classical. While I’ve not honed in on a niche in the field, I’m most interested in black hole physics, gravitational waves, cosmology, background-independent theories of quantum gravity, and relativistic alternatives to dark matter.

Please feel free to check out the rest of the site for more info. If you’re looking to get in touch, my contact information can be found in the sidebar to the left (or the “Follow” button, if you’re on mobile).
