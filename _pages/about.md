**Hi!** I'm Mace, and I test software for space telescopes.

I'm a systems engineer at[Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://www.stsci.edu/), supporting integration and testing for the [Webb (JWST)](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) and [Roman](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/) ground systems, serving as secondary lead for the Data Management Subsystem (DMS) for both missions. I also lead test automation efforts for the Certification, Integration, and Test Engineering Branch (CITEB).

I'm an astrophysicist by training, with B.A.s in astronomy and physics from Wesleyan University. While at Wesleyan, I [researched black hole X-ray binaries and strong gravitational lensing](https://mvtea.github.io/research/), [headed up the student observatory](https://mvtea.github.io/outreach/), and [taught telescope operation and data science for astronomy](https://mvtea.github.io/teaching/).

My research interests lie somewhere in the intersection of data science, simulation, and gravitational astrophysics. Gravitational wave signal processing, black hole theory, LISA/Einstein, and alternative theories of relativity are chief among them.
