Hi! My name is Mason, and I'm currently a Systems Engineer at the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://www.stsci.edu/), supporting integration and testing for the [James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) mission.

I did my undergrad at Wesleyan University, where I studied astronomy & physics and graduated with high honors in astronomy in 2021. My honors thesis, advised by [Dr. Roy Kilgard](http://rkilgard.faculty.wesleyan.edu/), focused on identifying and characterizing new black hole [X-ray binaries (XRBs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary) in nearby galaxies. Before that, I worked with [Dr. Seth Redfield](https://sethredfield.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/) on simulating images from the [Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_gravitational_lens). 

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in gravity, both in theory and observation. I look forward to pursuing opportunities and collaborations involving astrophysical / theoretical black hole physics, multi-messenger / gravitational wave astronomy, dark matter / modified gravity, and the role compact objects can play in constraining theories of quantum gravity.

My most recent CV can be found [here](https://mvtea.github.io/files/mtea_jul21-cv.pdf).
