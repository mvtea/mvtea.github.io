Hi! My name is Mason. I'm a senior at Wesleyan University, pursuing degrees in astronomy and physics.

I spent the first two years of my undergrad career working on simulations of the **Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL)** under the guidance of Dr. Seth Redfield. I've since transitioned to high-energy observation, and am currently studying **ultraluminous x-ray binaries** in the local universe with *Chandra*. Please see my [Research](mvtea.github.io/research) page for more information.

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in gravity, both in theory and observation. In particular, I look forward to pursuing opportunities dealing with both astrophysical and theoretical black hole physics, multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy and the role compact objects can play in contraining a theory of quantum gravity.

Opportunities for outreach and teaching have proven to be my favorite aspects of studying astronomy. I've been the **Student Director** of Van Vleck Observatory at Wesleyan since 2019, giving me the responsibility of training students to observe on our 24" Perkin research telescope and helping to maintain the telescope facilities. I am also a co-founder of Wesleyan's astronomy club, **WesAstro**, alongside Benjamin C.O. Martinez (B.A. '21) and Gilberto Garcia (B.A. '20). To hear more about this and other outreach I'm involved in, please see my [Outreach](mvtea.github.io/outreach) page. My teaching experience can be found on my [CV](mvtea.github.io/cv).
