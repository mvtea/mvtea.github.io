Hi! My name is Mason, and I'm currently a teaching assistant for the astrophysics section of the [Summer Science Program (SSP)](https://summerscience.org/). In August, I'll be joining the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://www.stsci.edu/) as an Associate Systems Engineer to support the [James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/) mission.

I did my undergrad at Wesleyan University, where I studied astronomy & physics and graduated with high honors in astronomy in 2021. My honors thesis, advised by [Dr. Roy Kilgard](http://rkilgard.faculty.wesleyan.edu/), focused on identifying and characterizing new black hole [X-ray binaries (XRBs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary) in nearby galaxies. Before that, I worked with [Dr. Seth Redfield](https://sethredfield.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/) on simulating images from the [Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_gravitational_lens). 

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in gravity, both in theory and observation. In particular, I look forward to pursuing research opportunities involving both astrophysical and theoretical black hole physics, multi-messenger / gravitational wave astronomy, and the role compact objects can play in constraining a theory of quantum gravity.
