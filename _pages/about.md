Hi! My name is Mason, and I'm a senior at Wesleyan University, graduating in May 2021 with Bachelor's degrees in astronomy and physics.

I currently work with [Dr. Roy Kilgard](http://rkilgard.faculty.wesleyan.edu/) on **identifying and characterizing X-ray binaries in the local universe with _Chandra_**. Before that, I worked on **simulations of images from the Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL)** under the guidance of [Dr. Seth Redfield](https://sethredfield.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/). Please see my [Research](mvtea.github.io/research) page for more information.

I was the **Student Director of Van Vleck Observatory** at Wesleyan from 2019-2021, and was involved in a few astronomy outreach projects on campus as well. To hear more about this and other public projects, please see my [Outreach](mvtea.github.io/outreach) page. My teaching experience, among other things, can be found on my [CV](mvtea.github.io/cv).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in gravity, both in theory and observation. In particular, I look forward to pursuing opportunities dealing with both astrophysical and theoretical black hole physics, multi-messenger / gravitational wave astronomy, and the role compact objects can play in constraining a theory of quantum gravity.
