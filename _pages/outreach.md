## Student Director, Van Vleck Observatory (*Fall 2019 - Present*)

As the student director, I'm responsible for training students on the observatory's 24" [Perkin research telescope](https://www.wesleyan.edu/astro/van-vleck/telescopes.html), selecting targets to be observed by the telescope operators during their shifts, and helping to maintain the telescope and its facilities. I've also been involved in the installation of our [new 24" PlaneWave telescope](https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2020/07/22/new-24-telescope-to-provide-better-research-opportunities-for-astronomy-students-faculty/) this summer, and look forward to leading students in operating this piece of state-of-the-art equipment this fall.

## Co-founder, Wesleyan Astronomy & Space Club (WesAstro) (*Fall 2018 - Present*)

Founded alongside Benjamin C.O. Martinez '21 and Gilberto Garcia '20, WesAstro is an astronomy club for majors and non-majors alike at Wesleyan University. We meet bi-weekly to discuss a topic in astronomy with students after a short presentation by myself, Ben and/or Gil.

## Co-founder, Cosmology & Astroparticle Physics Journal Club (CAPPJC) (*Spring 2019 - Present*)

Founded alongside Benjamin C. O. Martinez '21 and Nikki Pallat '21 as a way to get more exposure to emerging topics in interesting fields not represented in Wesleyan's research, members of CAPPJC meet weekly to discuss recent papers in these fields.

## Member, Wesleyan Astronomy Diversity Journal Club (DJC) (*Summer 2020 - Present*)

The astronomy department at Wesleyan, in light of the events surrounding the murder of George Floyd at the hands of racist police, has chosen to reinstitute the DJC, an initiative started by [Dr. Kevin Flaherty](https://kevinflaherty.weebly.com/) as a postdoc here at Wes. The DJC is comprised of both students and faculty and meets bi-weekly to discuss an article related to diversity in astronomy, STEM or in general, with the goal of reflecting on the department's own shortcomings and organizing to improve. I am currently working on developing a graphical and online identity for the initiative, alongside Prof. Seth Redfield and David Vizgan (B.A. '21).

## Reading course on gravitational theory (*Spring 2018 - Spring 2019*)

I approached [Professor George Paily](http://gmpailyteaching.weebly.com/) in my sophomore year about learning more about gravitational theory, and he kindly agreed to take me on as a student. Starting with tensor calculus and ending with an overview of the spacetime physics of black holes, this "course" further invigorated my passion for strong gravity.

## Telescope operator (*Fall 2017 - Present*)

Though the [24" Perkin research telescope](https://www.wesleyan.edu/astro/van-vleck/telescopes.html#24inch) at Wesleyan is undergoing some technical difficulties at the moment (which, as Student Director, I have been working to alleviate), I've been operating the telescope since by freshman fall and hope to be doing the same with the brand-new [24" PlaneWave telescope](https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2020/07/22/new-24-telescope-to-provide-better-research-opportunities-for-astronomy-students-faculty/) in the near future.

## Volunteer, Space Night and Kids' Night @ VVO (*Fall 2019 - Present*)

Space Nights are evenings at Van Vleck Observatory where the public are encouraged to come listen to an engaging presentation given by an astronomy student and observe with our telescopes. In the case of Kids' Night, a short activity is prepared by students for children from the community to participate in while learning about astronomy. I've been involved as a volunteer for these events.
