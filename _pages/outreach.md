## Student Director, Van Vleck Observatory (*Fall 2019 - Present*)

As the student director, I'm responsible for training students on the observatory's 24" [Perkin research telescope](https://www.wesleyan.edu/astro/van-vleck/telescopes.html), selecting targets to be observed by the telescope operators during their shifts, and helping to maintain the telescope and its facilities. I've also been involved in the installation of our [new 24" PlaneWave telescope](https://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2020/07/22/new-24-telescope-to-provide-better-research-opportunities-for-astronomy-students-faculty/) this summer, and look forward to leading students in operating this piece of state-of-the-art equipment this fall.

## Member, Wesleyan Astronomy Diversity Journal Club (DJC) (*Summer 2020 - Present*)

The astronomy department at Wesleyan, in light of the events surrounding the murder of George Floyd at the hands of racist police, has chosen to reinstitute the DJC, an initiative started by [Dr. Kevin Flaherty](https://kevinflaherty.weebly.com/) as a postdoc here at Wes. The DJC is comprised of both students and faculty and meets bi-weekly to discuss an article related to diversity in astronomy, STEM or in general, with the goal of reflecting on the department's own shortcomings and organizing to improve. My current organizing role, alongside David Vizgan (B.A. '21) and Prof. Seth Redfield, deals with branding and advertising our initiative.

## Space Night and Kids' Night @ VVO

Space Nights are evenings at Van Vleck Observatory where the public are encouraged to come listen to an engaging presentation given by an astronomy student and observe with our telescopes. In the case of Kids' Night, a short activity is prepared by students for children from the community to participate in while learning about astronomy. I've been involved as a volunteer for these events.

## Co-founder, WesAstro

Founded alongside Benjamin C.O. Martinez '21 and Gilberto Garcia '20, WesAstro is an astronomy club for majors and non-majors alike at Wesleyan University. We meet bi-weekly to discuss a topic in astronomy with students after a short presentation by myself, Ben and/or Gil.
