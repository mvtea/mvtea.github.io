## About the program
The goal of the program is to give budding astronomers at Wesleyan the opportunity to gain experience operating a research telescope. Students utilize Van Vleck Observatory's 24" Perkin research telescope, collecting data for use in a range of faculty- and student-run research projects, detailed below.

*If you are an astronomy student and would like to request time on the 24" telescope, either for ASTR 211 labs or for research purposes, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMn7RQEd4paIEX8NGl-RFvgRU78goxKI_uZwzgIcnM2LuqRw/viewform).*

### Current projects

* *Transiting white dwarfs*: A longstanding project under supervision of Professor Seth Redfield, lightcurves from observations of white dwards are analyzed in search of exoplanets orbiting these objects.

* *Galactic tidal streams*: Started by Wes astronomy alumnus Anthony Santini (B.A. '18, M.A. '19), this project looks for streams of matter ejected from galaxies after interactions with other galaxies.

* *Transient black hole binaries*: While the 24" is no exception to the fact that X-ray emission can't be seen with ground-based instruments, this project looks for emission from the optical counterparts (stars) of X-ray binaries identified by senior astronomy major Mason V. Tea using data from the *Chandra* X-ray space telescope.

### Getting involved
Wesleyan students are welcome to contact the Student Director, Mason V. Tea (mtea@wesleyan.edu), with questions about getting involved with the program. Preference is given to (1) astronomy majors, (2) prospective astronomy majors and (3) those taking/having taken one of ASTR 155 or ASTR 211 <i>and/or</i> involved in research in the astronomy department.
